    Ability to view which items have been checked out                                                             & Time saving for end-user, who no longer has to go through every item in a large list

    Ability to be used for both general inventory management as well as having attribute fields for library books &
    The stakeholders would prefer for the system to be able to be dual-purpose. Adding library book fields to a inventory system
    is rather trivial and greatly increases the usefulness of the system.                                                                                                                                          \\

    the new system for the next acedemic year, including dealing with new resources purchased over

    with mobile devices, and should be able to access the system using these devices for it to be
    used effectively.                                                                                                                                                                                              \\

    Students should be able to check out items such as books themselves                                           & The current system at
    the Hill School requires a staff member to check out books which reduces the times when books
    can be checked out. It would be beneficial if (older) students could check out books instead of only staff.                                                                                                    \\

    the ability to upload images to be used as thumbnails for items. Ella told us that it would be more "fun" for the user if they could click on images instead of just text.                                     \\
